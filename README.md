# NextJS Template - by Acea Spades

This is a starter template for NextJS projects. it includes:

- NextJS
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Husky
- Lint Staged
- Cypress

# Get Started

1. After clining the repo, run `yarn` to install all the dependencies.
    - Not using yarn? Delete `yarn.lock`, then run `npm install` instead. Or, run `npm install -g yarn` to install yarn (it's debatably better than npm; pick your team, green or blue).

2. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server.

3. Run `yarn build` to build the project.

That's it!


# Folder Structure


# Testing
## Cypress

---
# Precommit Hooks
## Husky
### Commitlint?
I've opted out of using commitlint for the time being, but I may add it in the future.

---

# Linting

A combination of ESLint, Prettier, and Husky are used to lint the codebase.

# Styling

Tailwind for most styling, with custom CSS.
