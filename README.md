# Cosmetics Company Code Test
## Overview

- Search by product name, description, and/or tags (rudimentary; exact string match)
- Server-side mock data storage and serving
- Visual styling with CSS / Tailwind

There are plenty of improvements that can be made, particularly in the visual style of the ProductCards, but this is a start.

# NextJS Template - by Acea Spades

This is based on my personal starter template for NextJS projects. it includes:

- NextJS
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Husky
- Lint Staged
- Cypress

# Get Started

1. After cloning the repo, run `yarn` to install all the dependencies.
    - Not using yarn? Delete `yarn.lock`, then run `npm install` instead. Or, run `npm install -g yarn` to install yarn.

2. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server (default http://localhost:3000)

3. Run `yarn build` to build a production version of the project.

That's it!
